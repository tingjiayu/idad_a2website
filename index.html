        <h2>Process on Assignment 2</h2>
        <h2>Conceptual Response</h2>
        <p>
          My prototype is an interactive memory–exploration website with five
          scenes, each tied to a different stage of life. On load, a blur layer
          covers the background GIFs to suggest distant or unclear memories.
          Users can click on the screen to erase parts of the blur and gradually
          reveal the image, or press the large Listen button to clear everything
          at once and start the music. This mirrors how memories shift from
          vague to vivid, and turns the act of revealing into a personal,
          playful interaction. By combining blurred visuals with sound, the
          design encourages both curiosity and reflection, making the
          exploration of memories feel active rather than passive.
        </p>

              This website has inspired me. A page can start blurry and then
              become clear when a button is clicked. And it can generate
              different web page styles based on the different locations where
              users are.

            <p>
              This website gave me the idea of designing to erase the blur layer
              after clicking on the page, adding some interactive designs to the
              website.

      <section id="implementation">
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          Built on the provided audio system using <strong>Tone.js</strong> for
          sound. A top blur layer masks a background GIF; clicks add reveal
          masks, while the <em>Listen</em> button clears the layer and starts
          music. For the advanced technique, I’m using
          <strong>Date.now()</strong>
          to relate scene selection to time (e.g., year memory mapping &
          progress stamping).
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, I considered creating a mouse catcher–style effect (where
          the blur dynamically follows the cursor), but I realized this was too
          complex for my current skills. Instead, I simplified the interaction
          to mouse clicks on the screen, which erase the blur in localized
          spots. This still gives a strong sense of discovery and interaction,
          while being more achievable within my technical ability.
        </p>

        <h2>Peer User Testing</h2>
        <p><strong>Prompts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Was it clear to you what actions (clicking the screen or pressing
            the Listen button) would do on this site?
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Did you find it easy to control the site and understand how to
            move from the blurred state to the clear state?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Reflection:</strong> Most users found the Listen button clear
          and easy to use, but many did not realize that clicking on the blurred
          screen could also reveal content and play audio. The year dropdown and
          arrows were confusing, as testers expected clearer visual changes when
          selecting them. Some also wondered if it was possible to return the
          screen to a blurred state.
        </p>

        <p>
          From this feedback, I learned that while the concept is engaging, I
          need to add stronger signifiers and feedback — especially for the
          screen click and year navigation. In the next iteration, I plan to
          make the clickable areas more obvious, refine the year selection so it
          always triggers visible scene changes, and consider adding a “re-blur”
          option so users feel more in control of switching states.

      <h2>Assignment 3: Reflection</h2>

      <h3>Design Values</h3>
      <p>
        I focused on two values: <strong>immersion</strong> and
        <strong>emotional connection</strong>. I wanted the site to be quiet and
        reflective, almost like holding a small photo book. Blur stands for
        distance; sound brings things back. Together, they create a soft rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        These values guided actual choices: full-screen media, minimal UI text,
        centered captions, and a clear Listen button. The goal was: less
        reading, more feeling. Let the interaction explain itself.
      </p>

      <h3>Feedback, Information Design, Mapping, Learnability</h3>
      <p>
        Feedback is direct: moving the mouse reveals clarity; pressing “Listen”
        makes the scene fully clear and starts BGM. The mapping is simple:
        forward means later in time; backward means earlier. The hint “scroll”
        word on the right side helps first-time users without being loud.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information design stays light. The top bar shows time distance and
        current time (when enabled). The caption at the bottom gives a short
        line to suggest mood, not to explain everything. This keeps learnability
        high: users can start exploring without instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        From peer feedback, I learned that people get lost if they don’t know
        what to do at the start. So I added an intro page to set the tone and
        tell users the two main actions: move to reveal, press Listen to recall.
      </p>

      <h3>Significant Changes Since the Progress Milestone</h3>
      <p>
        Compared to the prototype, I made three key changes to the UI structure
        and concept:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Vertical → Horizontal (Horizontal Scroll):</strong>
          Originally, the prototype used a vertical scroll, but it felt too
          similar to a regular website. After feedback, I redesigned it as a
          horizontal scroll, so users move sideways like turning pages in a
          memory album. This change gave the whole project a stronger narrative
          flow — every slide now feels like a separate moment in time. It also
          made the transition between memories smoother, because the movement
          across the screen visually echoes the idea of moving forward through
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Listen mode + automatic BGM switching:</strong> In the first
          version, users had to manually click the Listen button every time they
          entered a new scene, which interrupted the experience. I changed the
          logic so that once Listen mode is activated, the background music
          automatically switches for each scene as the user scrolls. This made
          the project feel more continuous and immersive, like a single memory
          unfolding. It also simplified interaction — users can now focus more
          on the visuals and atmosphere instead of managing controls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Date.now() time linking:</strong> I added a small but
          meaningful technical feature using Date.now(). The current time of the
          user’s system now influences both the blur strength and the audio
          filter slightly. The site subtly “breathes” with the present moment —
          for example, visiting it at different times of day makes the sound
          tone and visual softness slightly different. It’s not something every
          user will immediately notice, but it helps reinforce the theme that
          memories are always connected to the present.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These changes improved consistency and clarity, and made the work fit
        the theme of “time—memory—interaction” much better.

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Impact:</em> Small decisions changed the overall experience a lot.
        The horizontal flow feels more like moving through time. Auto BGM
        switching keeps the journey continuous, so users don’t have to stop and
        think. The time link is subtle, but it adds a sense that the page is
        alive and connected to “now.” Altogether, the site feels more natural
        and closer to the feeling of memory I wanted.
      </p>

      <h3>Timeline & Process</h3>
      <p>
        I started with the layout in HTML/CSS, then added scene data, then
        interactions (scroll, reveal, Listen), and finally connected time with
        Date.now() and sound with Tone.js. I tried values for blur (8–24px) and
        audio filters until the pacing felt right.
      </p>
      <p>
        A rough timeline: Week 6: layout + first scene; Week 7-8: five scenes +
        captions; Week 9: Listen mode + audio chain; Week 10: horizontal scroll
        + intro; Week 11: time linking + polish (centered captions, clearer
        Listen, light “scroll” hint).
      </p>
      <p>
        What helped me most was testing while building. Some choices only felt
        right after trying them (for example, how fast the reveal should follow
        the mouse, and how strong the blur should be on older scenes).
      </p>

      <h3>Most Proud Of</h3>
      <p>
        I’m proud of how the blur and sound now work together to express memory.
        Older scenes are more blurred and muffled, while newer ones are clearer
        and brighter — it feels natural, like how memories fade and sharpen over
        time. The horizontal layout also helps tell that story without needing
        extra labels; it feels like turning pages in a photo book.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like the new mouse “catcher” effect. It makes the reveal feel
        more playful and interactive, as if you’re uncovering small pieces of
        memory instead of just clicking a button. This small change made the
        experience more engaging and expressive.
      </p>

      <h3>Most Challenging</h3>
      <p>
        The hardest part was connecting everything so it felt smooth. Early on,
        the music didn’t switch when scrolling, and sometimes the blur layer
        disappeared. I had to adjust the logic so each page resets correctly and
        plays its own BGM in Listen mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another challenge came from peer feedback. Some people said the
        interaction wasn’t clear at first, so I added an introduction page and
        changed the action from “tap to clear blur” to the mouse catcher effect.
        It made the concept easier to understand and more fun to explore.
      </p>
      <p>
        These fixes taught me that user testing really matters — what feels
        obvious to me might not be obvious to others, and sometimes small
        changes can completely improve the experience.
      </p>

      <h3>Accessibility & Performance Notes</h3>
      <p>
        I tried to keep motion gentle and added reduced-motion support with CSS
        when possible. For performance, I plan to replace large GIFs with WebM
        videos to lower file size and improve playback. Images and audio are
        preloaded per scene to avoid sudden gaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also kept contrast reasonable on captions and buttons, and centered
        the caption to match the top bar width, so the reading path feels stable
        across scenes.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Small interaction changes (like auto BGM switching) can change the
          whole mood.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mapping time to both blur and sound makes the concept easier to feel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Testing with real users is important—intro and hints matter more than
          I thought.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keeping the UI quiet (less text, clearer actions) helps people focus
          on the experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Future Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        I want to add more personal-time features, like tinting the visuals
        based on the current date, so each visit feels a bit different. I’ll
        also switch big GIFs to WebM for smoother performance. Overall, I want
        to keep building interactions that feel gentle and meaningful, not just
        functional.
