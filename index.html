        <h2>Process on Assignment 2</h2>
        <h2>Conceptual Response</h2>
        <p>
          My prototype is an interactive memory–exploration website with five
          scenes, each tied to a different stage of life. On load, a blur layer
          covers the background GIFs to suggest distant or unclear memories.
          Users can click on the screen to erase parts of the blur and gradually
          reveal the image, or press the large Listen button to clear everything
          at once and start the music. This mirrors how memories shift from
          vague to vivid, and turns the act of revealing into a personal,
          playful interaction. By combining blurred visuals with sound, the
          design encourages both curiosity and reflection, making the
          exploration of memories feel active rather than passive.
        </p>

              This website has inspired me. A page can start blurry and then
              become clear when a button is clicked. And it can generate
              different web page styles based on the different locations where
              users are.

            <p>
              This website gave me the idea of designing to erase the blur layer
              after clicking on the page, adding some interactive designs to the
              website.

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          Built on the provided audio system using <strong>Tone.js</strong> for
          sound. A top blur layer masks a background GIF; clicks add reveal
          masks, while the <em>Listen</em> button clears the layer and starts
          music. For the advanced technique, I’m using
          <strong>Date.now()</strong>
          to relate scene selection to time (e.g., year memory mapping &
          progress stamping).
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, I considered creating a mouse catcher–style effect (where
          the blur dynamically follows the cursor), but I realized this was too
          complex for my current skills. Instead, I simplified the interaction
          to mouse clicks on the screen, which erase the blur in localized
          spots. This still gives a strong sense of discovery and interaction,
          while being more achievable within my technical ability.
        </p>

        <h2>Peer User Testing</h2>
        <p><strong>Prompts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Was it clear to you what actions (clicking the screen or pressing
            the Listen button) would do on this site?
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Did you find it easy to control the site and understand how to
            move from the blurred state to the clear state?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Reflection:</strong> Most users found the Listen button clear
          and easy to use, but many did not realize that clicking on the blurred
          screen could also reveal content and play audio. The year dropdown and
          arrows were confusing, as testers expected clearer visual changes when
          selecting them. Some also wondered if it was possible to return the
          screen to a blurred state.
        </p>

        <p>
          From this feedback, I learned that while the concept is engaging, I
          need to add stronger signifiers and feedback — especially for the
          screen click and year navigation. In the next iteration, I plan to
          make the clickable areas more obvious, refine the year selection so it
          always triggers visible scene changes, and consider adding a “re-blur”
          option so users feel more in control of switching states.

      <h2>Assignment 3: Reflection</h2>

      <h3>Design Values</h3>
      <p>
        I focused on two values: <strong>immersion</strong> and
        <strong>emotional connection</strong>. I wanted the site to be quiet and
        reflective, almost like holding a small photo book. Blur stands for
        distance; sound brings things back. Together, they create a soft rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        These values guided actual choices: full-screen media, minimal UI text,
        centered captions, and a clear Listen button. The goal was: less
        reading, more feeling. Let the interaction explain itself.
      </p>

      <h3>Feedback, Information Design, Mapping, Learnability</h3>
      <p>
        Feedback is direct: moving the mouse reveals clarity; pressing “Listen”
        makes the scene fully clear and starts BGM. The mapping is simple:
        forward means later in time; backward means earlier. The hint “scroll”
        word on the right side helps first-time users without being loud.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information design stays light. The top bar shows time distance and
        current time (when enabled). The caption at the bottom gives a short
        line to suggest mood, not to explain everything. This keeps learnability
        high: users can start exploring without instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        From peer feedback, I learned that people get lost if they don’t know
        what to do at the start. So I added an intro page to set the tone and
        tell users the two main actions: move to reveal, press Listen to recall.
      </p>

      <h3>Significant Changes Since the Progress Milestone</h3>
      <p>
        Compared to the prototype, I made three key changes to the UI structure
        and concept:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Vertical → Horizontal (Horizontal Scroll):</strong> users now
          swipe sideways like turning a memory album; the storytelling feels
          stronger.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Listen mode + automatic BGM switching:</strong> users press
          Listen once, and each page plays its own audio as they move forward;
          the experience is smoother.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Date.now() time linking:</strong> the current time is
          connected to blur and audio parameters; the scene “breathes” slightly
          so memories feel present.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These changes improved consistency and clarity, and made the work fit
        the theme of “time—memory—interaction” much better.
        <figure class="comparison">
          <img src="old.GIF" alt="Prototype version of Memory Carousel" />

        </figure>

          <figcaption>
            Final version — horizontal timeline with sound and blur interaction
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Impact:</em> Small decisions changed the overall experience a lot.
        The horizontal flow feels more like moving through time. Auto BGM
        switching keeps the journey continuous, so users don’t have to stop and
        think. The time link is subtle, but it adds a sense that the page is
        alive and connected to “now.” Altogether, the site feels more natural
        and closer to the feeling of memory I wanted.
      </p>

      <h3>Timeline & Process</h3>
      <p>
        I started with the layout in HTML/CSS, then added scene data, then
        interactions (scroll, reveal, Listen), and finally connected time with
        Date.now() and sound with Tone.js. I tried values for blur (8–24px) and
        audio filters until the pacing felt right.
      </p>
      <p>
        A rough timeline: Week 6: layout + first scene; Week 7-8: five scenes +
        captions; Week 9: Listen mode + audio chain; Week 10: horizontal scroll
        + intro; Week 11: time linking + polish (centered captions, clearer
        Listen, light “scroll” hint).
      </p>
      <p>
        What helped me most was testing while building. Some choices only felt
        right after trying them (for example, how fast the reveal should follow
        the mouse, and how strong the blur should be on older scenes).
      </p>

      <h3>Most Proud Of</h3>
      <p>
        I’m proud of how blur and sound work together. Older scenes are more
        blurred and muffled; newer ones are clearer and brighter. It feels
        natural, like how memories work in your head. I also like that the
        horizontal layout quietly supports the idea of time without needing
        extra labels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another small win is the mouse “catcher” effect. It turns the reveal
        into a playful action, not just a click, so users can “search” through
        the memory.
      </p>

      <h3>Most Challenging</h3>
      <p>
        The hardest part was making everything connect smoothly. At first, music
        didn’t switch when scrolling, and sometimes the blur layer disappeared.
        I tried a few approaches and ended up resetting state per page and
        switching BGM in Listen mode. Now the flow is better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also learned a lot from peer feedback. Some people felt the theme and
        interaction weren’t clear enough at the start. So I added an
        introduction page and changed the interaction from “tap to clear blur”
        to a mouse catcher effect. It’s clearer, more playful, and less
        repetitive.
      </p>

      <h3>Accessibility & Performance Notes</h3>
      <p>
        I tried to keep motion gentle and added reduced-motion support with CSS
        when possible. For performance, I plan to replace large GIFs with WebM
        videos to lower file size and improve playback. Images and audio are
        preloaded per scene to avoid sudden gaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also kept contrast reasonable on captions and buttons, and centered
        the caption to match the top bar width, so the reading path feels stable
        across scenes.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Small interaction changes (like auto BGM switching) can change the
          whole mood.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mapping time to both blur and sound makes the concept easier to feel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Testing with real users is important—intro and hints matter more than
          I thought.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keeping the UI quiet (less text, clearer actions) helps people focus
          on the experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Future Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        I want to add more personal-time features, like tinting the visuals
        based on the current date, so each visit feels a bit different. I’ll
        also switch big GIFs to WebM for smoother performance. Overall, I want
        to keep building interactions that feel gentle and meaningful, not just
        functional.
