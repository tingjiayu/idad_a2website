        <h2>Conceptual Response</h2>
        <p>
          My prototype is an interactive memory–exploration website with five
          scenes, each tied to a different stage of life. On load, a blur layer
          covers the background GIFs to suggest distant or unclear memories.
          Users can click on the screen to erase parts of the blur and gradually
          reveal the image, or press the large Listen button to clear everything
          at once and start the music. This mirrors how memories shift from
          vague to vivid, and turns the act of revealing into a personal,
          playful interaction. By combining blurred visuals with sound, the
          design encourages both curiosity and reflection, making the
          exploration of memories feel active rather than passive.

              This website has inspired me. A page can start blurry and then
              become clear when a button is clicked. And it can generate
              different web page styles based on the different locations where
              users are.

              This website gave me the idea of designing to erase the blur layer
              after clicking on the page, adding some interactive designs to the
              website.

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          Built on the provided audio system using <strong>Tone.js</strong> for
          sound. A top blur layer masks a background GIF; clicks add reveal
          masks, while the <em>Listen</em> button clears the layer and starts
          music. For the advanced technique, I’m using
          <strong>Date.now()</strong>
          to relate scene selection to time (e.g., year memory mapping &
          progress stamping).
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, I considered creating a mouse catcher–style effect (where
          the blur dynamically follows the cursor), but I realized this was too
          complex for my current skills. Instead, I simplified the interaction
          to mouse clicks on the screen, which erase the blur in localized
          spots. This still gives a strong sense of discovery and interaction,
          while being more achievable within my technical ability.

        <h2>Peer User Testing</h2>
        <p><strong>Prompts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Was it clear to you what actions (clicking the screen or pressing
            the Listen button) would do on this site?
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Did you find it easy to control the site and understand how to
            move from the blurred state to the clear state?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Reflection:</strong> Most users found the Listen button clear
          and easy to use, but many did not realize that clicking on the blurred
          screen could also reveal content and play audio. The year dropdown and
          arrows were confusing, as testers expected clearer visual changes when
          selecting them. Some also wondered if it was possible to return the
          screen to a blurred state.
        </p>

        <p>
          From this feedback, I learned that while the concept is engaging, I
          need to add stronger signifiers and feedback — especially for the
          screen click and year navigation. In the next iteration, I plan to
          make the clickable areas more obvious, refine the year selection so it
          always triggers visible scene changes, and consider adding a “re-blur”
          option so users feel more in control of switching states.
